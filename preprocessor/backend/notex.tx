Dont forget that:


React will act as the frontend of our application,
It's where you design and build things like buttons, forms, tables, and charts that users will interact with.


About FASTAPI:

FastAPI is the framework that defines the structure and logic of your backend.
Itâ€™s where we define routes (API endpoints) that handle specific user requests (like uploading CSV files).
FastAPI is responsible for validating inputs, handling requests, and sending responses back to the client (your React frontend)


ABOUT UVICORN (ASGI SERVER):

Uvicorn is the server that runs the FastAPI app.
It's responsible for actually starting the server and making sure your API is accessible over the network (local or online).
It hosts the FastAPI app and listens for incoming HTTP requests (like uploading files) and sends the corresponding responses back to the user.
Think of Uvicorn as the engine that powers your FastAPI app.



When a user sends a request (e.g., uploading a CSV file), Uvicorn forwards it to FastAPI, which processes it and sends a response back.


**Example Workflow**:

    User uploads a CSV in the React frontend.
    React sends a POST request to FastAPI with the CSV file.
    FastAPI processes the CSV, cleans the data, and computes statistics.
    FastAPI sends the processed data or results back to React.
    React displays the results (like showing the cleaned data in a table or providing statistics in a chart).
